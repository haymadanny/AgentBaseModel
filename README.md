Agent Base Model (ABM)

The ABM is a model that:
1. builds agents in a space;
2. gets them to interact with each other;
3. reads in environmental data;
4. gets agents to interact with the environment;
5. randomizes the order of agent actions;
6. displays the model as an animation;
7. is contained within a Graphical User Interface (GUI);
8. is initialised with data from the web.

This ABM is designed and developmented in the Python programming language. 

More information on the ABM can be found on http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python/

This ABM was designed, and taught to Masters students of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) by Dr. Andrew Evans (http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.evans/), University of Leeds.
