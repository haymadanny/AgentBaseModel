Agent Base Model (ABM)

The ABM is a model that:
•	builds agents in a space;
•	gets them to interact with each other;
•	reads in environmental data;
•	gets agents to interact with the environment;
•	randomizes the order of agent actions;
•	displays the model as an animation;
•	is contained within a Graphical User Interface (GUI);
•	is initialised with data from the web.

This ABM is designed and developmented in the Python programming language. 

More information on the ABM can be found on http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python/
This ABM was designed, and taught to Masters students of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) by Dr. Andrew Evans (http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.evans/), University of Leeds.
